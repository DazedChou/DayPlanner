# Day Planner

This project is a day planner where the user can add important events in their respective time block so that the user can effectively manage his or her time. The timeblocks are color-coded using moment.js so that each timeblock is easily distinguishable based on the past, present, and future hours. And these events that the user saves is then saved into local storage, so when the page refreshes, the text present in the text area is preserved.

## Getting Started
